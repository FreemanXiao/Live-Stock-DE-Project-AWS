# S&P 500, NASDAQ, and The Big Seven: Live Stock & ETF Data Engineering Project â€“ Serverless on AWS

## Project Overview

This project centers on advanced data engineering techniques applied to the S&P 500 index, NASDAQ index, and data from seven major US tech giants. Leveraging AWS serverless technology, we've implemented a sophisticated ETL pipeline orchestration to seamlessly ingest, transform, and analyze daily stock and ETF data sourced via the Alpha Vantage API. Our primary objective is to provide detailed daily stock updates, summaries of stock information over a period of time, and perform rigorous analysis, with a specific emphasis on technology stocks and trends in the US stock market, particularly focusing on large-cap technology stocks and market trends.

Stock & ETF showed in the project:
- ETF: VOO (Represent S&P 500); QQQ(Represent NASDAQ)
- Stock: AAPL (Apple Inc.); AMZN(Amazon.com Inc.); META (Meta Platforms, Inc.); GOOGL (Alphabet Inc.); MSFT (Microsoft Corporation); NVDA (Nvidia Corporation); TSLA (Tesla, Inc.)
